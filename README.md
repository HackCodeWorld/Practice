# Practice:
The following `Practice` section will combine practice source code and diagrams to combine the theory from algorthm design and code implementation.

# Purpose:
Help all beginners and myself to spend the least time to prepare and review for all algo concepts and quickly getting into real coding problems.

# Description(Steps): 
- Programming Language/Concept Refresh
- Data Structure Basic
- Graph
- Greedy
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Network Flow
- Intractability
- Randomization and Approximation

# Prerequisites:
